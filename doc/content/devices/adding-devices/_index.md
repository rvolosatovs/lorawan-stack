Devices can be added to {{%tts%}} by following instructions for [Adding Devices in the Console]({{< ref "/getting-started/console/create-end-device" >}}) or [Adding Devices Using the Command-line interface]({{< ref "/getting-started/cli/create-end-device" >}}).

Once a device has been added, get started with [Integrations]({{< ref "/integrations" >}}) to process and act on data.

Integrations allow you to process and act on data by triggering events. Events can be pretty much anything, and can easily be set up using Webhooks or MQTT.

Integrations are managed within applications. Applications can be added to {{%tts%}} by following instructions for [Adding Applications in the Console]({{< ref "/getting-started/console/create-application" >}}) or [Adding Applications Using the Command-line interface]({{< ref "/getting-started/cli/create-application" >}}).

Once an application has been added, learn how to work with the [Application Server MQTT server]({{< ref "/integrations/mqtt" >}}) and [HTTP webhooks]({{< ref "/integrations/webhooks" >}}).

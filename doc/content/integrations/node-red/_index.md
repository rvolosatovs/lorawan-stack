[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) is a free, JavaScript-based development tool for visual programming, developed to ease the process of wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services.

The MQTT server that is exposed by {{% tts %}} can be connected to Node-RED. This integration allows setting up a Node-RED flow that listens to events and messages sent by end devices. It is also possible to send messages to the end devices.

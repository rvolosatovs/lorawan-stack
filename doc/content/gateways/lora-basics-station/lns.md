This page contains information about connecting your gateway to {{% tts %}} using the {{% lns %}} (LNS) protocol.

<!--more-->

## Requirements

1. User account on {{% tts %}} with rights to create gateways.

## Create a Gateway

Follow instructions for [Adding Gateways in the Console]({{< ref "/getting-started/console/create-gateway" >}}) or [Adding Gateways Using the Command-line interface]({{< ref "/getting-started/cli/create-gateway" >}}).

## Create an API Key {{< new-in-version "3.9" >}}

LNS requires an API Key with the following rights:
- Link as Gateway to a Gateway Server for traffic exchange, i.e. write uplink and read downlink

If you have not already created one, follow instructions for [Creating a Gateway API Key in the Console]({{< ref "/getting-started/console/create-gateway#create-gateway-api-key" >}}) or [Creating a Gateway API Key Using the Command-line interface]({{< ref "/getting-started/cli/create-gateway#create-gateway-api-key" >}}).

## Configure Gateway

On your gateway, set the following configuration fields.

The `<server-address>` is the address of {{% tts %}}. If you followed the [Getting Started guide]({{< ref "/getting-started" >}}) this is the same as what you use instead of `thethings.example.com`.

The `<gateway-api-key>` is the API Key you created above. Create a file named `gateway-api.key` and copy your gateway API Key in as an HTTP header in the following format:

```
Authorization: <gateway-api-key>
```

Gateways can be added to {{%tts%}} by following instructions for [Adding Gateways in the Console]({{< ref "/getting-started/console/create-gateway" >}}) or [Adding Gateways Using the Command-line interface]({{< ref "/getting-started/cli/create-gateway" >}}).

Once a gateway has been added, get started with [Adding Devices]({{< ref "/devices/adding-devices" >}}) and [Integrations]({{< ref "/integrations" >}}) to process and act on data.

Before going further into in the documentation, getting to know the *Concepts* used throughout the stack is a must if you want to use the network at its full capacity.

*Concepts* are features (set of), key factors and implementations that make TTN stack unique and powerful. If you are interested in the different possibilities the stack offers then this is the right place.

This section will not have guides on how to use this or that feature but it will help you understand how they work, so you can make better use of them. Each concept section will answer the following questions:
* What is it?
* What is it for?
* How does it work?

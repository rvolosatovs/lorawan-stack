## Create a New Application on {{% tts %}}

Create a new application on {{% tts %}} where the end devices will be imported. This can be done from by following instructions for [Adding Application]({{< ref "integrations/adding-applications" >}}).

Using the instructions, create an application called `imported-application` and make sure it is properly linked with the Network Server.

> **NOTE**: In {{% tts %}}, applications do not have an `AppEUI`. The `AppEUI` is configured per-device.

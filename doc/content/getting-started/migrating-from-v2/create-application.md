## Create a New Application on {{% tts %}}

Create a new application on {{% tts %}} where the end devices will be
imported. This can be done from by following instructions for [Creating an Application in the Console]({{% ref "getting-started/console/create-application" %}})
or [Creating an Application using the CLI]({{% ref "getting-started/cli#create-application" %}}).

Using the linked instructions, create an application called `imported-application`.

> **NOTE**: In {{% tts %}}, applications do not have an `AppEUI`. The `AppEUI` is
> configured per-device.

> **NOTE**: If creating the application using the CLI, do not forget to
> [link with the Network Server]({{% ref "getting-started/cli#link-application" %}}).

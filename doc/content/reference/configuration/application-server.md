## Linking Options

The Application Server links to a Network Server. The `link-mode` configures how linking occurs.

- `as.link-mode`: Mode to link applications to their Network Server (all, explicit) (default "all")

## Security Options

- `as.device-kek-label`: Label of KEK used to encrypt device keys at rest

## Interoperability Options

The `as.interop` options configure how Application Server performs interoperability with other LoRaWAN Backend Interfaces-compliant servers.

- `as.interop.id`: AS-ID used for interoperability
- `as.interop.config-source`: Source of the interoperability client configuration (directory, url, blob)
- `as.interop.blob.bucket`: Blob bucket, which contains interoperability client configuration
- `as.interop.blob.path`: Blob path, which contains interoperability client configuration
- `as.interop.directory`: OS filesystem directory, which contains interoperability client configuration
- `as.interop.url`: URL, which contains interoperability client configuration

## MQTT Options

Application Server exposes an MQTT server for streaming data.

- `as.mqtt.listen`: Address for the MQTT frontend to listen on (default ":1883")
- `as.mqtt.listen-tls`: Address for the MQTTS frontend to listen on (default ":8883")
- `as.mqtt.public-address`: Public address of the MQTT frontend (default "localhost:1883")
- `as.mqtt.public-tls-address`: Public address of the MQTTs frontend (default "localhost:8883")

## HTTP Webhooks Options

Application Server has an internal queue with worker routines for outgoing requests. When remote endpoints are not fast enough and queue (with `queue-size`) gets full, new traffic gets discarded. You can tune these parameters for optimal performance, considering memory consumption with a large queue size and number of workers.

- `as.webhooks.queue-size`: Number of requests to queue (default 16)
- `as.webhooks.target`: Target of the integration (direct) (default "direct")
- `as.webhooks.timeout`: Wait timeout of the target to process the request (default 5s)
- `as.webhooks.workers`: Number of workers to process requests (default 16)

Application Server supports templates for webhooks that can be loaded from a `directory` or `url`.

- `as.webhooks.templates.directory`: Retrieve the webhook templates from the filesystem
- `as.webhooks.templates.url`: Retrieve the webhook templates from a web server
- `as.webhooks.templates.logo-base-url`: The base URL for the logo storage

In order to send uplinks and receive downlinks from your device, you must link the Application Server to the Network Server. In order to do this, create an API key for the Application Server:

```bash
$ ttn-lw-cli applications api-keys create \
  --name link \
  --application-id app1 \
  --right-application-link
```

The CLI will return an API key such as `NNSXS.VEEBURF3KR77ZR...`. This API key has only link rights and can therefore only be used for linking.

You can now link the Application Server to the Network Server:

```bash
$ ttn-lw-cli applications link set app1 --api-key NNSXS.VEEBURF3KR77ZR..
```

Your application is now linked. You can now use the builtin MQTT server and webhooks to receive uplink traffic and send downlink traffic.

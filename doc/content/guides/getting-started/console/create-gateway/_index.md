## Step by step

Your gateway will be created and you will be redirected to the gateway overview page of your newly created gateway.

You can now connect your gateway to {{% tts %}}.

### Create Gateway API Key

Some gateways require an API Key with Link Gateway Rights to be able to connect to {{% tts %}}.

In order to do this, navigate the **API Keys** menu of your gateway and select **Add API Key**. Enter a name for your key, select the **Link as Gateway to a Gateway Server for traffic exchange, i.e. write uplink and read downlink** right and then press **Create API Key**.

You will see a screen that shows your newly created API Key. You now can copy it in your clipboard by pressing the clipboard button. After saving the key in a safe place, press **I have copied the key**. You will not be able to see this key again in the future, and if you lose it, you can create a new one to replace it in the gateway configuration.

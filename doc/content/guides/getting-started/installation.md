## Preparation

Since we're going to install The Things Stack using Docker and Docker Compose, follow the guides to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms) and to [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose).

Most releases contain an example `docker-compose.yml` file. You can also find this file [in the Github repository of The Things Stack]({{% repo-file-url "raw" "docker-compose.yml" %}}). In this guide we'll use that example `docker-compose.yml` for our deployment.

## Command-line Interface (optional)

Although the web interface of The Things Stack (the Console) currently has support for all basic features of The Things Stack, for some actions, you need to use the command-line interface (CLI). The CLI allows you to manage all features of The Things Stack.

You can use the CLI on your local machine and on the server.

>Note: if you need help with any CLI command, use the `--help` flag to get a list of subcommands, flags and their description and aliases.

### Package managers (recommended)

#### macOS

```bash
$ brew install TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-stack/ttn-lw-stack
```

#### Linux

```bash
$ sudo snap install ttn-lw-stack
$ sudo snap alias ttn-lw-stack.ttn-lw-cli ttn-lw-cli
```

### Binaries

You can download [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-stack/releases) for your operating system and processor architecture.

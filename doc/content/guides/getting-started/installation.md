## CLI and stack

The command-line interface (CLI) allows you to manage all features of The Things Stack. The web interface (Console) supports most actions, however, for some actions, you need to use the CLI.

You can use the CLI on your local machine and on the server.

>Note: if you need help with any CLI command, use the `--help` flag to get a list of subcommands, flags and their description and aliases.

Interval:
  description: The duration between messages.
  link: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/duty-cycle.html

Duty Cycle:
  description: The fraction of time a device is busy. When a single device transmits on a channel for 2 time units every 10 time units, this device has a duty cycle of 20%.
  link: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/duty-cycle.html

Data Rate:
  description: A combination of Bandwidth and Spreading Factor which defines how quickly a message is transmitted.
  link: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/modulation-data-rate.html

Bandwidth:
  description: LoRaWAN can use channels with a bandwidth of either 125 kHz, 250 kHz or 500 kHz, depending on the region or the frequency plan. Making the bandwidth 2x wider (from BW125 to BW250) allows you to send 2x more bytes in the same time.
  link: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/modulation-data-rate.html

Spreading Factor:
  description: Making the spreading factor 1 step lower (from SF10 to SF9) allows you to send 2x more bytes in the same time. Lowering the spreading factor makes it more difficult for the gateway to receive a transmission, as it will be more sensitive to noise.

Classes:
  description: The LoRaWAN specification defines three device types. All LoRaWAN devices must implement Class A, whereas Class B and Class C are extensions to the specification of Class A devices.
  link: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/classes.html

Class A:
  description: Class A devices support bi-directional communication between a device and a gateway. Uplink messages (from the device to the server) can be sent at any time (randomly). The device then opens two receive windows at specified times (1s and 2s) after an uplink transmission.
  link: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/classes.html

Class B:
  description: Class B devices extend Class A by adding scheduled receive windows for downlink messages from the server. Using time-synchronized beacons transmitted by the gateway, the devices periodically open receive windows.
  link: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/classes.html

Class C:
  description: Class C devices extend Class A by keeping the receive windows open unless they are transmitting. This allows for low-latency communication but is many times more energy consuming than Class A devices.

Application EUI, Join EUI:
  description: The Join EUI (formerly called App EUI) is a 64 bit extended unique identifier used to identify the join server during activation. This should be provided by the device manufacturer for pre-provisioned devices, or by the owner of the join server you will use.

AppKey, Application Key:
  description: A device specific encryption key used during OTAA to generate NwkSKey and AppSKey. This is usually pre provisioned by the device manufacturer, but can also be created by the user.

OTAA, Over the Air Activation:
  description: The preferred method to join a LoRaWAN network, offering more flexibility, security, and scalability than ABP.
  link: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/devices/bestpractices.html

ABP, Activation by Personalisation:
  description: Manually provisioning device keys to join a LoRaWAN network. Less flexible, less secure, and less scalable than OTAA, but sometimes useful during demos, to avoid waiting for a downlink window to join a network.

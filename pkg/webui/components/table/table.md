The `<Table />` component can be used to display data in a tabular way. It is implemented using a well-known design pattern, namely `Compound Component`. The main idea is to keep the `jsx` markup clean, implicitly connect nested components and allow the users to arrange `ui` elements as needed.

Besides that, there is the `<Tabular />` component, that uses the `<Table />` and implements the default table that should serve most of the use cases within the application.

# The Things Network Stack for LoRaWAN

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TheThingsNetwork/ttn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TheThingsNetwork/ttn) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/TheThingsNetwork/ttn/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/TheThingsNetwork/ttn?branch=master) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/go.thethings.network/lorawan-stack?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/go.thethings.network/lorawan-stack)

The Things Network Stack for LoRaWAN is an open-source LoRaWAN network stack suitable for large, global and geo-distributed public and private networks as well as smaller networks. The architecture follows the LoRaWAN Network Reference Model for standards compliancy and interoperability.

LoRaWAN is a protocol for low-power wide area networks. It allows for large scale Internet of Things deployments where low-powered devices efficiently communicate with Internet-connected applications over long range wireless connections.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to set up a private network is with the provided [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml).

0. Prerequisites
    - Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
    - Make sure you have a TLS certificate and key ready. We'll expect a `cert.pem` and `key.pem`. For development, you can generate self-signed certificates with `make dev.certs`.
1. Pull the Docker images:
    ```sh
    docker-compose pull
    ```
2. Initialize the database:
    ```sh
    docker-compose run --rm stack is-db init
    ```
3. Create the `admin` user:
    ```sh
    docker-compose run --rm stack is-db create-admin-user \
      --id admin --email admin@example.com
    ```
    You can choose a different user ID if you want. If you do, make sure to use
    that for `owner` below.
4. Register the CLI as an OAuth client:
    ```sh
    docker-compose run --rm stack is-db create-oauth-client \
      --id cli --name "Command Line Interface" --no-secret \
      --owner admin \
      --redirect-uri 'http://localhost:11885/oauth/callback'
    ```
5. Register the Console as an OAuth client:
    ```sh
    docker-compose run --rm stack is-db create-oauth-client \
      --id console --name "Console" \
      --owner admin \
      --redirect-uri 'http://example.com:1885/console/oauth/callback' \
      --redirect-uri 'https://example.com:8885/console/oauth/callback'
    ```
    Make sure to copy the value of the `secret` that is printed by this command.
6. Export the Console's OAuth client secret or replace it in your `docker-compose.yml`:
    ```sh
    export TTN_LW_CONSOLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<PASTE SECRET HERE>
    ```
7. Run the Stack:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```
